        <p>The greasy potato sticks that a lot of people crave for.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds of sliced russet potatoes (alternatively, use frozen fries)</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon rosemary or paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If you're not using frozen fries, slice potatoes into sticks and place into a bowl of cold water.</li>
            <li>Boil oil to around 350Â° F. If you're not sure and don't have a thermometer, place a fry and see if it immediately boils.</li>
            <li>Stir all other ingredients except the oil and fries into a bowl to make a batter. If it is too thin, add more flour; if too thick, add more water.</li>
            <li>Dip fries into batter and pat-dry with a towel.</li>
            <li>Boil fries into oil for approximately 4 minutes. Take out fries, pat-dry, and fry again for another 4 minutes. Serve and enjoy the crunchiness!</li>
        </ol>
