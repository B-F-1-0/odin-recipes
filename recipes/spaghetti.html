        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One of everyone's all-time favorites, this dish is served with pasta with a tomato or marinara sauce atop of it. Toppings can vary heavily by preference, but I usually like to put meatballs, bell peppers, and mushrooms on my type of spaghetti. A rather frugal meal that got me through the summer.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 chopped onion</li>

                    <li>1 jar spaghetti sauce</li>
                    <li>Alternatively, you can make your own sauce but I just use the jars of sauce as it's easier to make.</li>
                </ul>
